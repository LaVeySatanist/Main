<div id="t2_131" class="t s1_131">hatred out on them. </div>
<div id="t3_131" class="t s1_131">There is a definite period of the day when a person is in a more receptive state than during other </div>
<div id="t4_131" class="t s1_131">times. Assuming that the person regularly sleeps for eight hours, the receptive state comes in the </div>
<div id="t5_131" class="t s1_131">last two hours or so before awakening. This has been established as the period of time in which the </div>
<div id="t6_131" class="t s1_131">person has the dreams he can recall most easily. This is due to the fact that the person’s body has </div>
<div id="t7_131" class="t s1_131">completed its required rest; but the slow rate of metabolism keeps it dormant for a short time </div>
<div id="t8_131" class="t s1_131">afterwards, producing the most receptive time during total sleep. This is when we receive some of </div>
<div id="t9_131" class="t s1_131">our most fruitful ideas. It is the twilight period between sleep and waking. A person’s subconscious </div>
<div id="ta_131" class="t s1_131">is at its most active point during this period of time. It is during this period that a telepathic </div>
<div id="tb_131" class="t s1_131">communication would have the best chance of being received. To be most effective, therefore, your </div>
<div id="tc_131" class="t s1_131">magical working should be performed during this twilight period. </div>
<div id="td_131" class="t s1_131">There are many herbs and spices which are used in ritual magic. The most common ingredient </div>
<div id="te_131" class="t s1_131">used in love potions is mandrake root. Just as most acts which are considered evil are within the </div>
<div id="tf_131" class="t s1_131">law, so some of the most effective ingredients used in potions can be legally obtained. There is no </div>
<div id="tg_131" class="t s1_131">need to resort to popular and/or illegal drugs for any magical purpose. </div>
<div id="th_131" class="t s1_131">The magical language used in Satanic ritual is Enochian. Enochian is a language which is </div>
<div id="ti_131" class="t s1_131">thought to be older than Sanskrit, with a sound grammatical and syntactical basis. It was developed </div>
<div id="tj_131" class="t s1_131">into a practical translation, which is its current form, by Samuel Liddell MacGregor Mathers. In </div>
<div id="tk_131" class="t s1_131">Enochian the meaning of the words, combined with the quality of the words, unite to create a </div>
<div id="tl_131" class="t s1_131">pattern of sound which can cause tremendous reaction in the atmosphere. The barbaric tonal </div>
<div id="tm_131" class="t s1_131">qualities of this language give it a truly magical effect which cannot be described. </div>
<div id="tn_131" class="t s1_131">It is thought by most that all Satanic rituals are in the form of the Black Mass. This is a </div>
<div id="to_131" class="t s1_131">misconception. Most Satanic rituals have nothing in them which would be considered sacrilegious </div>
<div id="tp_131" class="t s1_131">to another religion. One of the reasons a Black Mass would be performed in the Satanic Church </div>
<div id="tq_131" class="t s1_131">would be to remove a stigma attached to the activities of one or several members. If a person feels </div>
<div id="tr_131" class="t s1_131">bound or stifled by a previous religion, a Black Mass would be performed to enable him to </div>
<div id="ts_131" class="t s1_131">completely divorce himself from the limiting factors of that past religion. </div>
<div id="tt_131" class="t s1_131">A Black Mass consists of such things as saying the Lord’s Prayer backwards -interspersed with </div>
<div id="tu_131" class="t s1_131">obscenities, trampling the cross underfoot or hanging it upside-down, desecration of the wafer or </div>
<div id="tv_131" class="t s1_131">host, and similar forms of defilement or parody of the sacred cows which make the religion a threat </div>
<div id="tw_131" class="t s1_131">to the person involved. By reducing the awesomeness of the religion to ridiculousness, we remove </div>
<div id="tx_131" class="t s1_131">its fearsomeness. </div>
<div id="ty_131" class="t s1_131">The only other circumstance in which a Black Mass would be performed would be one in which </div>
<div id="tz_131" class="t s1_131">another religion had directly attacked the Satanic Church. To perform a Black Mass just for its </div>
<div id="t10_131" class="t s1_131">shock value would serve no useful purpose. The Christian religion is no threat to the Satanist. One </div>
<div id="t11_131" class="t s1_131">might say that the Devil has kept all the religions on earth in business for many, many years. If it </div>
<div id="t12_131" class="t s1_131">were not for these religions which he has allowed to flourish, Satan could not come forth now and </div>
<div id="t13_131" class="t s1_131">establish his organized church, built on the very episcopacy and structure of the existing religions. </div>
<div id="t14_131" class="t s1_131">Satanism is taken up by most people not out of protest, but out of logic. Therefore the </div>
<div id="t15_131" class="t s1_131">debasement of their previous religions is unnecessary. There are many sacred cows in our current </div>
<div id="t16_131" class="t s1_131">society which warrant protest as much if not more than the Christian religion. A modern-day form </div>
<div id="t17_131" class="t s1_131">of the Black Mass might consist of such things as urinating on marijuana, crushing an LSD sugar </div>
<div id="t18_131" class="t s1_131">cube under foot, hanging a picture of Timothy Leary or a famous Indian guru upside-down, </div>
<div id="t19_131" class="t s1_131">exposing the parallel between the Hippie generation and the “emperor’s new clothes.” These things </div>
<div id="t1a_131" class="t s1_131">would be far more effective to the magical workings of a Satanist than a typical Black Mass. </div>
<div id="t1b_131" class="t s1_131">The results of a magical working will start to manifest themselves within thirty-six hours from </div>
<div id="t1c_131" class="t s1_131">the time the ritual was performed. Once the magical working has been performed, you must push </div>
<div id="t1d_131" class="t s1_131">all thoughts of hope or anxiety from your mind. You have released your emotions and sent them out </div>
<div id="t1e_131" class="t s1_131">into the ether, where they can effect your desired results. After this there is nothing left to do but sit </div>
<div id="t1f_131" class="t s1_131">back and wait for the results. Anxiety only acts to lessen the effectiveness of your working. </div>
<div id="t1g_131" class="t s1_131">The Satanic ritual is not always confined to sinister or occult surroundings. The true magician is </div>
<div id="t1h_131" class="t s1_131">adept at turning any situation he encounters into a magical working. He can manipulate his </div>
<div id="t1i_131" class="t s1_131">surroundings to his best advantage. </div>
<div id="t1j_131" class="t s1_131">A ritual which is performed for the sake of reducing an awesome figure to a ridiculous state is </div>
