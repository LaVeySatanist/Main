<div id="t1_13" class="t s1_13">those who proclaim it to be a danger to justice and cooperative order have missed the point entirely. </div>
<div id="t2_13" class="t s1_13">Satanism advocates unrestricted freedom, but only to the extent that one’s preferences do not </div>
<div id="t3_13" class="t s1_13">impinge upon another’s. It should also be noted that Satanism is a philosophy of the individual, not </div>
<div id="t4_13" class="t s1_13">of the mass. There are no collective policy statements save the famous Crowley admonition: “Self-</div>
<div id="t5_13" class="t s1_13">deceit is the gravest of all ‘sins’.” </div>
<div id="t6_13" class="t s1_13">While the majority of the populace may instinctively incline to a de facto Satanism, the Church </div>
<div id="t7_13" class="t s1_13">cautions that its propositions are not for the irresponsible. There are no Satanic missionaries, and to </div>
<div id="t8_13" class="t s1_13">affiliate one must meet exacting standards. Inexperience is not dishonored, but pretentiousness, </div>
<div id="t9_13" class="t s1_13">hypocrisy, and pomposity are treated with the scorn that they deserve. Satanism is no less an art </div>
<div id="ta_13" class="t s1_13">than it is a science, and there is “no standard of measurement deified”. </div>
<div id="tb_13" class="t s1_13">Dr. LaVey is uniquely prepared to author the new Diabolism. An American of Georgian, </div>
<div id="tc_13" class="t s1_13">Alsatian, and Romanian Gypsy descent, he was quick to display the characteristic restlessness of </div>
<div id="td_13" class="t s1_13">his nomadic ancestors and an unusual empathy for their earthy, arcane lore. An early preoccupation </div>
<div id="te_13" class="t s1_13">with the military sciences led him to read the various logistical publications of the World War II </div>
<div id="tf_13" class="t s1_13">era, only to discover that the proud visions of martial glory entertained in the first world war had </div>
<div id="tg_13" class="t s1_13">given way to a detached, mercenary realism in the second. His experiences as a student did nothing </div>
<div id="th_13" class="t s1_13">to dispel this first taste of human cynicism, and LaVey’s growing impatience with the sterile </div>
<div id="ti_13" class="t s1_13">regimentation of conventional education drove him to seek the strange, surrealistic enchantments of </div>
<div id="tj_13" class="t s1_13">the circus. He assisted Clyde Beatty as a wild-animal trainer, and he soon developed a strong </div>
<div id="tk_13" class="t s1_13">affinity for the cats which was to mark his personality in a most curious manner. All animate </div>
<div id="tl_13" class="t s1_13">creatures are basically bestial, he reasoned, and even the most refined social orders achieve at best </div>
<div id="tm_13" class="t s1_13">only a flimsy suppression of this innate savagery. From the circus he proceeded to a carnival, where </div>
<div id="tn_13" class="t s1_13">the glitter of the performing arts was tinged with the ever-present struggle for daily subsistence. </div>
<div id="to_13" class="t s1_13">Here LaVey worked in a pathetic but quietly dignified world of misfits, sideshow freaks, and </div>
<div id="tp_13" class="t s1_13">human oddities; and here he was to learn the craft of the stage magician, whose success depends </div>
<div id="tq_13" class="t s1_13">upon the contrived distraction of the audience’s attention. With a certain grimness he noted the </div>
<div id="tr_13" class="t s1_13">fascination with which the “normal” man regards his deformed comrades - a gloating satisfaction </div>
<div id="ts_13" class="t s1_13">over the visiting of misfortune upon another instead of oneself. Becoming increasingly interested in </div>
<div id="tt_13" class="t s1_13">this cruel, lycanthropic attribute of human nature, he studied criminology in college and eventually </div>
<div id="tu_13" class="t s1_13">worked with the San Francisco Police Department as a photographer. </div>
<div id="tv_13" class="t s1_13">As a circus professional he had seen carnal man at his most artistic; now he was to view him at </div>
<div id="tw_13" class="t s1_13">his most vicious. Three years of the gore, brutality, and abject misery that permeate the criminal </div>
<div id="tx_13" class="t s1_13">subculture left him sickened, disillusioned, and angered with the rampant hypocrisy of polite </div>
<div id="ty_13" class="t s1_13">society. He turned to the pipe organ as a means of living and devoted the greater part of his efforts </div>
<div id="tz_13" class="t s1_13">to what was to become his life’s work - Black Magic. </div>
<div id="t10_13" class="t s1_13">LaVey had long since rejected the stereotypical tracts on ceremonial sorcery as the hysterical </div>
<div id="t11_13" class="t s1_13">products of medieval imaginations. The “Old Craft” with its superstitions, affected mannerisms, </div>
<div id="t12_13" class="t s1_13">and infantile parlor games was not for him; what he sought was a metaphysical psychology that </div>
<div id="t13_13" class="t s1_13">would approach the intellectual man only after giving due consideration to his brutal, animalistic </div>
<div id="t14_13" class="t s1_13">origins. And so he came at last to the Goat of Mendes. </div>
<div id="t15_13" class="t s1_13">Satan is easily the most enigmatic figure in classical literature. Possessed of every conceivable </div>
<div id="t16_13" class="t s1_13">wealth, and the most powerful of the Archangels, he spurned his exalted allegiance to proclaim his </div>
<div id="t17_13" class="t s1_13">independence from all that his Heavenly patron personified. Although condemned to the most </div>
<div id="t18_13" class="t s1_13">hideous of domains, a Hell totally shunned by the divinity, he embraced such privations as the </div>
<div id="t19_13" class="t s1_13">burden of his intellectual prerogative. In his Infernal Empire one might indulge even the most </div>
<div id="t1a_13" class="t s1_13">extraordinary tastes with impunity, yet amidst such wanton licentiousness the Devil maintained a </div>
<div id="t1b_13" class="t s1_13">peculiar nobility. It was this elusive quality which Anton LaVey determined to identify. </div>
<div id="t1c_13" class="t s1_13">After long years of research and experiment, he pronounced the guiding principle of Satanism: </div>
<div id="t1d_13" class="t s1_13">that the ultimate consequence of man lies not in unity but in duality. It is only synthesis that decides </div>
<div id="t1e_13" class="t s1_13">values; adherence to a single order is arbitrary and therefore insignificant. </div>
<div id="t1f_13" class="t s1_13">LaVey’s disturbing theories and bizarre operations of ceremonial Black Magic eventually </div>
<div id="t1g_13" class="t s1_13">attracted a following of similarly minded individuals. From this first small circle the Church of </div>
<div id="t1h_13" class="t s1_13">Satan was to emerge, attuned to its founder’s contention that its messages would be presented most </div>
<div id="t1i_13" class="t s1_13">effectively through “nine parts social respectability to one part of the most blatant outrage”. </div>
