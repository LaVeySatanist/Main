<div id="tb_20" class="t s3_20">by Magus Peter H. Gilmore </div>
<div id="tc_20" class="t s3_20">This book has the potential to change your life – it did mine. It is a diabolical work, written with </div>
<div id="td_20" class="t s3_20">elegance, earthiness, and might, serving quite magically as a mirror. If you look within these pages </div>
<div id="te_20" class="t s3_20">and see yourself; if you find its principles to be those you’ve lived by as long as you can remember; </div>
<div id="tf_20" class="t s3_20">if you feel the evocation of an overwhelming sense of homecoming, then you will have discovered </div>
<div id="tg_20" class="t s3_20">that you are a part of a scattered “meta-tribe,” and the proper name for what you are is “Satanist.” </div>
<div id="th_20" class="t s3_20">I first encountered Anton Szandor LaVey through </div>
<div id="ti_20" class="t s2_20">The Satanic Bible</div>
<div id="tj_20" class="t s3_20">, at the age of thirteen when </div>
<div id="tk_20" class="t s3_20">I was an avowed atheist. Not being partial to literature promoting faith of any sort, I was pleasantly </div>
<div id="tl_20" class="t s3_20">surprised that this was no rant by someone claiming direct contact with Satan. </div>
<div id="tm_20" class="t s3_20">Instead, I found a common sense, rational, materialist philosophy, along with theatrical ritual </div>
<div id="tn_20" class="t s3_20">techniques meant as self-transformative psychodrama. Here was a tool perfectly suited to my nature </div>
<div id="to_20" class="t s3_20">as a means for getting the most out of my life. I knew that “atheist” was no longer sufficient as a </div>
<div id="tp_20" class="t s3_20">designation for myself. This book lead me to meet and befriend LaVey, working with him to </div>
<div id="tq_20" class="t s3_20">administer the Church he created, and finally to succeed him as the second High Priest of the </div>
<div id="tr_20" class="t s3_20">Church of Satan. </div>
<div id="ts_20" class="t s3_20">It is one of Anton LaVey’s numerous talents that his written words are vivid, brimming with his </div>
<div id="tt_20" class="t s3_20">distinct personality. His well-wrought phrases give the sense of encountering the man himself, and </div>
<div id="tu_20" class="t s3_20">such an impression is not a delusion. When my wife, Peggy Nadramia, and I met The Doctor” (an </div>
<div id="tv_20" class="t s3_20">affectionate moniker used by those close him), we agreed that here was exactly the man we had </div>
<div id="tw_20" class="t s3_20">dared to expect from reading his books. </div>
<div id="tx_20" class="t s3_20">Unlike the founders of</div>
<div id="ty_20" class="t s3_20">other religions who claimed ‘inspiration” delivered through some </div>
<div id="tz_20" class="t s3_20">supernatural entity, LaVey readily acknowledged that he used his own faculties to synthesize </div>
<div id="t10_20" class="t s3_20">Satanism. He based it on both his understanding of the human animal acquired from life experience </div>
<div id="t11_20" class="t s3_20">and the wisdom he’d gained from other advocates of materialism, pragmatism, and individualism. </div>
<div id="t12_20" class="t s3_20">His blasphemously named “Church of Satan” was consciously designed to be an adversary to </div>
<div id="t13_20" class="t s3_20">existing “spiritual’ belief systems. It was the first organization promulgating </div>
<div id="t14_20" class="t s3_20">religious philosophy </div>
<div id="t15_20" class="t s3_20">championing Satan as the symbol of liberty and individualism. Concerning his role as founder he </div>
<div id="t16_20" class="t s3_20">said that, “If he didn’t do it himself, someone else, per haps less qualified, would have.” His </div>
<div id="t17_20" class="t s3_20">perceptive insights thus lead him to give a proper name to a human type that has always been part </div>
<div id="t18_20" class="t s3_20">of our species. </div>
<div id="t19_20" class="t s3_20">LaVey was born in Chicago in 1930, and his parents soon relocated to California, that </div>
<div id="t1a_20" class="t s3_20">westernmost gathering place for the brightest and darkest manifestations of that “American </div>
<div id="t1b_20" class="t s3_20">Dream.” It was a fertile environment for the sensitive child who would eventually mature into a </div>
<div id="t1c_20" class="t s3_20">role the press would dub “The Black Pope.” From his Eastern European grandmother, young </div>
<div id="t1d_20" class="t s3_20">LaVey learned of the superstitions that are still extant in that part of the world. These tales whetted </div>
<div id="t1e_20" class="t s3_20">his appetite for the outré, leading him to become absorbed in classic dark literature such as Dracula </div>
<div id="t1f_20" class="t s3_20">and Frankenstein. He also became an avid reader of the pulp magazines, which first published tales </div>
<div id="t1g_20" class="t s3_20">now deemed classics of the horror and science fiction genres. He later befriended seminal Weird </div>
<div id="t1h_20" class="t s3_20">Tales authors such as Clark Ashton Smith, Robert Barbour Johnson, and George Has. His fancy </div>
<div id="t1i_20" class="t s3_20">was captured by fictional characters found in the works of Jack London and Somerset Maugham, in </div>
<div id="t1j_20" class="t s3_20">comic strip characters like Ming the Merciless, as well as by historical figures of a diabolical cast </div>
<div id="t1k_20" class="t s3_20">such as Cagliostro, Rasputin, and Basil Zaharoff. More interesting to him than the available occult </div>
<div id="t1l_20" class="t s3_20">literature, which he dismissed as being little more than sanctimonious white magic, were books </div>
<div id="t1m_20" class="t s3_20">applied obscure knowledge such as Dr. William Wesley Cook’s Practical Lessons in Hypnotism, </div>
<div id="t1n_20" class="t s3_20">Jane’s Fighting Ships, and manuals for handwriting analysis. </div>
<div id="t1o_20" class="t s3_20">His musical abilities were noticed early, and he was given free reign by his parents to try his </div>
<div id="t1p_20" class="t s3_20">hand at various instruments. LaVey was mainly attracted to the keyboards because of their scope </div>
