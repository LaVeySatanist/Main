<div id="t4_16" class="t s1_16">humanoids of LaVey’s creation. </div>
<div id="t5_16" class="t s1_16">All of LaVey’s background seemed to prepare him for his role. He is the descendant of </div>
<div id="t6_16" class="t s1_16">Georgian, Roumanian, and Alsatian grandparents, including a gypsy grandmother who passed on to </div>
<div id="t7_16" class="t s1_16">him the legends of vampires and witches in her native Transylvania. As early as the age of five, </div>
<div id="t8_16" class="t s1_16">LaVey was reading </div>
<div id="t9_16" class="t s2_16">Weird-Tales</div>
<div id="ta_16" class="t s1_16">magazines and books such as Mary Shelly’s </div>

<div id="te_16" class="t s2_16">Dracula</div>
<div id="tf_16" class="t s1_16">. Though he was different from other children, they appointed him as leader </div>
<div id="tg_16" class="t s1_16">in marches and maneuvers in mock military orders. </div>
<div id="th_16" class="t s1_16">In 1942, when LaVey was twelve, his fascination with toy soldiers led to concern over World </div>
<div id="ti_16" class="t s1_16">War II. He delved into military manuals and discovered arsenals for the equipment of armies and </div>
<div id="tj_16" class="t s1_16">navies could be bought like groceries in a supermarket and used to conquer nations. The idea took </div>
<div id="tk_16" class="t s1_16">shape in his head that contrary to what the Christian Bible said, the earth would not be inherited by </div>
<div id="tl_16" class="t s1_16">the meek, but by the mighty. </div>
<div id="tm_16" class="t s1_16">In high school LaVey became something of an offbeat child prodigy. Reserving his most </div>
<div id="tn_16" class="t s1_16">serious studies for outside the school, he delved into music, metaphysics, and secrets of the occult. </div>
<div id="to_16" class="t s1_16">At fifteen, he became second oboist in the San Francisco Ballet Symphony Orchestra. Bored with </div>
<div id="tp_16" class="t s1_16">high school classes, LaVey dropped out in his Junior year, left home, and joined the Clyde Beatty </div>
<div id="tq_16" class="t s1_16">Circus as a cage boy, watering and feeding the lions and tigers. Animal trainer Beatty noticed that </div>
<div id="tr_16" class="t s1_16">LaVey was comfortable working with the big cats and made him an assistant trainer. </div>
<div id="ts_16" class="t s1_16">Possessed since childhood by a passion for the arts, for culture, LaVey was not content merely </div>
<div id="tt_16" class="t s1_16">with the excitement of training jungle beasts and working with them in the ring as a fill-in for </div>
<div id="tu_16" class="t s1_16">Beatty. By age ten he had taught himself to play the piano by ear. This came in handy when the </div>
<div id="tv_16" class="t s1_16">circus calliope player became drunk before a performance and was unable to go on; LaVey </div>
<div id="tw_16" class="t s1_16">volunteered to replace him, confident he could handle the unfamiliar organ keyboard well enough </div>
<div id="tx_16" class="t s1_16">to provide the necessary background music. It turned out he knew more music and played better </div>
<div id="ty_16" class="t s1_16">than the regular calliopist, so Beatty cashiered the drunk and installed LaVey at the instrument. He </div>
<div id="tz_16" class="t s1_16">accompanied the “Human Cannonball”, Hugo Zachinni, and the Wallendas’ high-wire acts, among </div>
<div id="t10_16" class="t s1_16">others. </div>
<div id="t11_16" class="t s1_16">When LaVey was eighteen he left the circus and joined a carnival. There he became assistant to </div>
<div id="t12_16" class="t s1_16">a magician, learned hypnosis, and studied more about the occult. It was a curious combination. On </div>
<div id="t13_16" class="t s1_16">the one side he was working in an atmosphere of life at its rawest level - of earthy music; the smell </div>
<div id="t14_16" class="t s1_16">of wild animals and sawdust; acts in which a second of missed timing meant accident or death; </div>
<div id="t15_16" class="t s1_16">performances that demanded youth and strength, and shed those who grew old like last year’s </div>
<div id="t16_16" class="t s1_16">clothes; a world of physical excitement that had magical attractions. On the other side, he was </div>
<div id="t17_16" class="t s1_16">working with magic in the dark side of the human brain. Perhaps the strange combination </div>
<div id="t18_16" class="t s1_16">influenced the way he began to view humanity as he played organ for carnival sideshows. </div>
<div id="t19_16" class="t s1_16">“On Saturday night,” LaVey recalled in one of our long talks, “I would see men lusting after </div>
<div id="t1a_16" class="t s1_16">half-naked girls dancing at the carnival, and on Sunday morning when I was playing organ for tent-</div>
<div id="t1b_16" class="t s1_16">show evangelists at the other end of the carnival lot, I would see these same men sitting in the pews </div>
<div id="t1c_16" class="t s1_16">with their wives and children, asking God to forgive them and purge them of carnal desires. And </div>
<div id="t1d_16" class="t s1_16">the next Saturday night they’d be back at the carnival or some other place of indulgence. I knew </div>
<div id="t1e_16" class="t s1_16">then that the Christian church thrives on hypocrisy, and that man’s carnal nature will out no matter </div>
<div id="t1f_16" class="t s1_16">how much it is purged or scourged by any white-light religion.” </div>
<div id="t1g_16" class="t s1_16">Though LaVey did not realize it then, he was on his way toward formulating a religion that </div>
<div id="t1h_16" class="t s1_16">would serve as the antithesis of Christianity and its Judaic heritage. It was an old religion, older </div>
<div id="t1i_16" class="t s1_16">than Christianity or Judaism. But it had never been formalized, arranged into a body of thought and </div>
<div id="t1j_16" class="t s1_16">ritual. That was to become LaVey’s role in twentieth-century civilization. </div>
<div id="t1k_16" class="t s1_16">After LaVey became a married man himself in 1951, at age twenty-one, he abandoned the </div>
<div id="t1l_16" class="t s1_16">wondrous world of the carnival to settle into a career better suited for homemaking. He had been </div>
<div id="t1m_16" class="t s1_16">enrolled as a criminology major at the City College of San Francisco. That led to his first </div>
<div id="t1n_16" class="t s1_16">conformist job, photographer for the San Francisco Police Department. As it worked out, that job </div>
<div id="t1o_16" class="t s1_16">had as much to do as any other with his development of Satanism as a way of life. </div>
<div id="t1p_16" class="t s1_16">“I saw the bloodiest, grimiest side of human nature,” LaVey recounted in a session dealing with </div>
