<div id="t1_18" class="t s1_18">rather the dark forces in nature that human beings are just beginning to fathom. How did LaVey </div>
<div id="t2_18" class="t s1_18">square that explanation with his own appearance at times in black cowl with horns? He replied: </div>
<div id="t3_18" class="t s1_18">“People need ritual, with symbols such as those you find in baseball games or church services or </div>
<div id="t4_18" class="t s1_18">wars, as vehicles for expending emotions they can’t release or even understand on their own.” </div>
<div id="t5_18" class="t s1_18">Nevertheless, LaVey himself soon tired of the games. </div>
<div id="t6_18" class="t s1_18">There were setbacks. First, some of LaVey’s neighbors began complaining about the full-grown </div>
<div id="t7_18" class="t s1_18">lion he was keeping as a house pet, and eventually the big cat was donated to the local zoo. Next, </div>
<div id="t8_18" class="t s1_18">one of LaVey’s most devoted witches, Jayne Mansfield, died under a curse he had placed on the </div>
<div id="t9_18" class="t s1_18">head of her suitor, lawyer Sam Brody, for a variety of reasons I have explained in </div>
<div id="ta_18" class="t s2_18">The Devil’s </div>
<div id="tb_18" class="t s2_18">Avenger;</div>
<div id="tc_18" class="t s1_18">LaVey had persistently warned her away from Brody and felt depressed over her death. It </div>
<div id="td_18" class="t s1_18">was the second tragic death in the sixties of a Hollywood sex symbol with whom he had been </div>
<div id="te_18" class="t s1_18">intimately involved; the other was Marilyn Monroe, LaVey’s paramour for a brief but crucial </div>
<div id="tf_18" class="t s1_18">period in 1948 when he had quit the carnival and was playing organ for strippers around the Los </div>
<div id="tg_18" class="t s1_18">Angeles area. </div>
<div id="th_18" class="t s1_18">On top of all that, LaVey was tired of organizing entertainments and purges for his church </div>
<div id="ti_18" class="t s1_18">members. He had gotten in touch with the last living remnants of the prewar occult fraternities of </div>
<div id="tj_18" class="t s1_18">Europe, was busily acquiring their philosophies and secret rituals left over from the pre-Hitler era, </div>
<div id="tk_18" class="t s1_18">and needed time to study, write and work out new principles. He had long been experimenting with </div>
<div id="tl_18" class="t s1_18">and applying the principles of geometric spatial concepts in what he terms “The Law of the </div>
<div id="tm_18" class="t s1_18">Trapezoid”. (He scoffs at current faddists who are “barking up the wrong pyramids”.) He was also </div>
<div id="tn_18" class="t s1_18">becoming widely sought as speaker, guest on radio and television programs, and production and/or </div>
<div id="to_18" class="t s1_18">technical adviser to scores of television producers and moviemakers turning out Satanic chillers. </div>
<div id="tp_18" class="t s1_18">Sometimes he was also an actor. As sociologist Clinton R. Sanders points out: “...no occultist has </div>
<div id="tq_18" class="t s1_18">had as direct an impact upon formulaic cinematic presentations of Satanism as has Anton Szandor </div>
<div id="tr_18" class="t s1_18">LaVey. Ritual and esoteric symbolism are central elements in LaVey’s church and the films in </div>
<div id="ts_18" class="t s1_18">which he has had a hand contain detailed portrayals of Satanic rites and are filled with traditional </div>
<div id="tt_18" class="t s1_18">occult symbols. The emphasis upon ritual in the Church of Satan is ‘intended to focus the emotional </div>
<div id="tu_18" class="t s1_18">powers within each individual’. Similarly, the ornate ritualism that is central to LaVey’s films may </div>
<div id="tv_18" class="t s1_18">reasonably be seen as a mechanism to involve and focus the emotional experience of the cinema </div>
<div id="tw_18" class="t s1_18">audience.” </div>
<div id="tx_18" class="t s1_18">At last LaVey decided to transfer rituals and other organized activities to Church of Satan </div>
<div id="ty_18" class="t s1_18">grottos around the world, and devote himself to writing, lecturing, teaching - and to his family: wife </div>
<div id="tz_18" class="t s1_18">Diane, the blonde beauty who serves as High Priestess of the Church; raven-haired daughter Karla, </div>
<div id="t10_18" class="t s1_18">now in her early twenties, a criminology major like her father before, spending much of her time </div>
<div id="t11_18" class="t s1_18">lecturing on Satanism at universities in many parts of the country; and finally Zeena, remembered </div>
<div id="t12_18" class="t s1_18">by people who saw the famous photo of the Satanic Church baptism as a tiny tot, but now a </div>
<div id="t13_18" class="t s1_18">gorgeously developed teenager attracting a growing pack of wolves, human male variety. </div>
<div id="t14_18" class="t s1_18">Out of LaVey’s relatively quiescent period came his widely read, pioneering books: First, </div>
<div id="t15_18" class="t s2_18">The </div>
<div id="t16_18" class="t s2_18">Satanic Bible,</div>
<div id="t17_18" class="t s1_18">which at this writing is in its twelfth edition (and this is my second, revised </div>
<div id="t18_18" class="t s1_18">introduction, after having written the original introduction to the first edition). Second, </div>
<div id="t19_18" class="t s2_18">The Satanic </div>
<div id="t1a_18" class="t s2_18">Rituals,</div>
<div id="t1b_18" class="t s1_18">which covers more of the somber, complex material LaVey unearthed from his increasing </div>
<div id="t1c_18" class="t s1_18">sources. And third, </div>
<div id="t1d_18" class="t s2_18">The Compleat Witch,</div>
<div id="t1e_18" class="t s1_18">a bestseller in Italy, but, sadly, allowed by its American </div>
<div id="t1f_18" class="t s1_18">publisher to go out of print with its potential unfulfilled. </div>
<div id="t1g_18" class="t s1_18">LaVey’s spreading out from organized church activities to writing books for worldwide </div>
<div id="t1h_18" class="t s1_18">distribution has, of course, greatly expanded Church of Satan membership. Satanism’s growing </div>
<div id="t1i_18" class="t s1_18">popularity has naturally been accompanied by scare stories from religious groups complaining that </div>
<div id="t1j_18" class="t s2_18">The Satanic Bible</div>
<div id="t1k_18" class="t s1_18">now outsells the Christian Bible on college campuses and is a leading causative </div>
<div id="t1l_18" class="t s1_18">factor in youngsters’ turning away from God. And certainly one suspects that Pope Paul had LaVey </div>
<div id="t1m_18" class="t s1_18">in mind when he issued his worldwide proclamation two years ago that the Devil is “alive” and “a </div>
<div id="t1n_18" class="t s1_18">person”, a living, fire-breathing character spreading evil over the earth. LaVey, maintaining that </div>
<div id="t1o_18" class="t s1_18">“evil” is “live” spelled backward and should be indulged in and enjoyed, answers the pope and the </div>
<div id="t1p_18" class="t s1_18">religious scare groups this way: </div>
<div id="t1q_18" class="t s1_18">“People, organizations, nations are making millions of dollars off us. What would they do </div>
<div id="t1r_18" class="t s1_18">without us? Without the Church of Satan, they wouldn’t have anybody to rage at and to take the </div>
<div id="t1s_18" class="t s1_18">blame for all the rotten things happening in the world. If they really feel this way, they shouldn’t </div>
