<div id="t4_21" class="t s1_21">many stints as an organist in bars, lounges, and nightclubs. These venues gave him the chance to </div>
<div id="t5_21" class="t s1_21">study how various melodic lines and chord progressions swayed the emotions of his audiences, </div>
<div id="t6_21" class="t s1_21">from the spectators at the carnival and spook shows to the individuals seeking solace for the </div>
<div id="t7_21" class="t s1_21">disappointments in their lives in distilled spirits and the smoke-filled taverns for which LaVey’s </div>
<div id="t8_21" class="t s1_21">playing provided a moody soundtrack. </div>
<div id="t9_21" class="t s1_21">His odd interests marked him as an outsider, and he did not alleviate this by feeling any </div>
<div id="ta_21" class="t s1_21">compulsion to be “one of the boys.” He despised gym class and team sports and often cut classes to </div>
<div id="tb_21" class="t s1_21">follow his own interests. Moving beyond the standard school texts, he absorbed volumes analyzing </div>
<div id="tc_21" class="t s1_21">human behavior on every level, from the impulses of the individual to the dynamics of the herd. He </div>
<div id="td_21" class="t s1_21">watched films that would later be labeled </div>
<div id="te_21" class="t s2_21">film noir</div>
<div id="tf_21" class="t s1_21">as well as German expressionist cinema such as </div>
<div id="tg_21" class="t s2_21">M, The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari</div>

<div id="ti_21" class="t s2_21">Dr. Mabuse</div>
<div id="tj_21" class="t s1_21">movies. His taste for flashy apparel also </div>
<div id="tk_21" class="t s1_21">served to amplify his alienation from the mainstream. </div>
<div id="tl_21" class="t s1_21">He dropped out of high school to hang around with hoodlum types and gravitated towards </div>
<div id="tm_21" class="t s1_21">working in the circus and carnivals, first as a roustabout and cage boy and later as a musician. His </div>
<div id="tn_21" class="t s1_21">always-active curiosity was rewarded as he “learned the ropes” from the carnies. He worked an act </div>
<div id="to_21" class="t s1_21">with the big cats–he had an affinity for these powerful predators-and later assisted with the </div>
<div id="tp_21" class="t s1_21">machinations of the spook shows. He became well-versed in the many rackets used to separate the </div>
<div id="tq_21" class="t s1_21">rubes from their money, along with the psychology that lead people to such pursuits. Under the </div>
<div id="tr_21" class="t s1_21">name “The Great Szandor” he played calliope and organ for the bawdy shows on Saturday nights, </div>
<div id="ts_21" class="t s1_21">as well as for tent revivalists on Sunday mornings, seeing many of the same men attending both and </div>
<div id="tt_21" class="t s1_21">noting this telling contradiction. All of these activities provided a firm, earthy background for his </div>
<div id="tu_21" class="t s1_21">evolving cynical worldview. </div>
<div id="tv_21" class="t s1_21">When the carnival season ended, LaVey would earn money by playing organ in Los Angeles </div>
<div id="tw_21" class="t s1_21">area burlesque houses, and he relates that it was during this period that he met and had a brief affair </div>
<div id="tx_21" class="t s1_21">with a then-unknown Marilyn Monroe, after accompanying her “chain-dragging” striptease at the </div>
<div id="ty_21" class="t s1_21">Mayan Burlesque Theater. Moving back to San Francisco, LaVey worked for a while as a </div>
<div id="tz_21" class="t s1_21">photographer for the police department, and, during the Korean War, enrolled in San Francisco City </div>
<div id="t10_21" class="t s1_21">College as a criminology major to avoid the draft. Both his studies and occupation revealed grim </div>
<div id="t11_21" class="t s1_21">insights into human nature and confirmed his rejection of spiritual doctrines. At this time he met </div>
<div id="t12_21" class="t s1_21">and married Carole Lansing, who bore him his first daughter Karla Maritza, in 1952. A few years </div>
<div id="t13_21" class="t s1_21">earlier LaVey had examined the writings of Aleister Crowley, so in 1951 he decided to meet some </div>
<div id="t14_21" class="t s1_21">of the Berkeley Thelemites. He was unimpressed, as they were more mystical and less “wicked” </div>
<div id="t15_21" class="t s1_21">than he supposed they should be for disciples of Crowley’s libertine creed. </div>
<div id="t16_21" class="t s1_21">During the 1950s, LaVey supplemented his income as an investigator of alleged supernatural </div>
<div id="t17_21" class="t s1_21">phenomena, handing “nut calls” referred to him by friends in the police department. These </div>
<div id="t18_21" class="t s1_21">experiences proved to him that many people were inclined to seek a bizarre, “otherworldly” </div>
<div id="t19_21" class="t s1_21">explanation for phenomena that had prosaic causes. His rational explanations often disappointed the </div>
<div id="t1a_21" class="t s1_21">complainants, so LaVey invented exotic sources to make them feel better, giving him insight as to </div>
<div id="t1b_21" class="t s1_21">how belief functions in people’s lives. </div>
<div id="t1c_21" class="t s1_21">In 1956 he purchased a Victorian house on California Street in San Francisco’s Richmond </div>
<div id="t1d_21" class="t s1_21">District. It was reputed to have been a speakeasy, and was tricked out with secret passages, possibly </div>
<div id="t1e_21" class="t s1_21">to aid in clandestine carnal activities. He painted it black, thus creating a haunted intrusion on an </div>
<div id="t1f_21" class="t s1_21">otherwise typical block, matching his own unique presence. It was only natural that it would later </div>
<div id="t1g_21" class="t s1_21">become home to the Church of Satan. After his death, the building remained unoccupied, a </div>
<div id="t1h_21" class="t s1_21">brooding “shunned house,” until it was demolished on October 17 of 2001 by the real estate </div>
<div id="t1i_21" class="t s1_21">company that owned the property. </div>
<div id="t1j_21" class="t s1_21">LaVey met and became entranced by Diane Hegarty in 1959; he then left Carole in 1960. </div>
<div id="t1k_21" class="t s1_21">Hegarty and LaVey never married, but she bore him his second daughter, Zeena Galatea in 1964 </div>
<div id="t1l_21" class="t s1_21">and was his companion for many years. Hegarty and LaVey later separated; she sued him for </div>
<div id="t1m_21" class="t s1_21">palimony and this was settled out of court. </div>
