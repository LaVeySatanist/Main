<div id="t1_10" class="t s1_10">In 1942, when he was twelve years old, LaVey’s fascination with toy soldiers branched off to </div>
<div id="t2_10" class="t s1_10">concern about the world war. He delved into military manuals and discovered that arsenals for the </div>
<div id="t3_10" class="t s1_10">equipment of armies and navies could be bought like groceries in a supermarket and used to </div>
<div id="t4_10" class="t s1_10">conquer masses of people. The idea took shape in his head that contrary to what the Bible said, the </div>
<div id="t5_10" class="t s1_10">earth would not be inherited by the meek, but by the strong and mighty. </div>
<div id="t6_10" class="t s1_10">After entering High School, LaVey became something of an offbeat child prodigy. He did most </div>
<div id="t7_10" class="t s1_10">of his studying outside the school, delving into music, metaphysics, and secrets of the occult. At </div>
<div id="t8_10" class="t s1_10">sixteen he became second oboist in the San Francisco Ballet Symphony Orchestra. Bored with high </div>
<div id="t9_10" class="t s1_10">school classes, he dropped out in his junior year, left home, and joined the Clyde Beatty Circus as a </div>
<div id="ta_10" class="t s1_10">cage boy, watering and feeding the lions and tigers. Animal trainer Beatty noticed that LaVey was </div>
<div id="tb_10" class="t s1_10">comfortable working with the big cats and made him an assistant trainer. </div>
<div id="tc_10" class="t s1_10">One day the circus calliope player became drunk. LaVey had taught himself to play the piano </div>
<div id="td_10" class="t s1_10">by ear and thought he could handle the organ keyboard well enough to provide some music for the </div>
<div id="te_10" class="t s1_10">performance that evening. It turned out that he played better and knew more music than the regular </div>
<div id="tf_10" class="t s1_10">player, so Beatty kept him on the calliope. He accompanied the “Human Cannonball,” Hugo </div>
<div id="tg_10" class="t s1_10">Zachinni, and the Wallendas’ high wire acts, among others. </div>
<div id="th_10" class="t s1_10">When he was eighteen, LaVey left the circus and joined a carnival. He became assistant to a </div>
<div id="ti_10" class="t s1_10">magician, learned hypnosis, and studied more about the occult. This was a curious combination. On </div>
<div id="tj_10" class="t s1_10">the one side, he was working in an atmosphere of life at its rawest level—of earthy music; the smell </div>
<div id="tk_10" class="t s1_10">of wild animals; acts in which a second of missed timing meant accident; performances that </div>
<div id="tl_10" class="t s1_10">demanded youth and strength, and shed those who grew old like last year’s clothes; a world of </div>
<div id="tm_10" class="t s1_10">physical excitement that had magical attractions. On the other side, he was working with the magic </div>
<div id="tn_10" class="t s1_10">in the dark side of the human mind. </div>
<div id="to_10" class="t s1_10">After he married, LaVey abandoned the wondrous world of the carnival to settle into a career </div>
<div id="tp_10" class="t s1_10">better suited for a home life. He enrolled as a criminology major at the City College of San </div>
<div id="tq_10" class="t s1_10">Francisco. That led to his first conformist job—photographer for the San Francisco Police </div>
<div id="tr_10" class="t s1_10">Department. As it worked out, that job had as much to do as any other with leading him toward </div>
<div id="ts_10" class="t s1_10">Satanism. </div>
<div id="tt_10" class="t s1_10">“I saw the bloodiest, grimiest side of human nature,” he recalls. “People shot by nuts, knifed by </div>
<div id="tu_10" class="t s1_10">friends, little kids splattered in the gutter by hit and run drivers. It was disgusting and depressing. I </div>
<div id="tv_10" class="t s1_10">asked myself: ‘Where is God?’ I came to detest the sanctimonious attitude of people toward </div>
<div id="tw_10" class="t s1_10">violence, always saying it’s God’s will.” </div>
<div id="tx_10" class="t s1_10">He quit in disgust after three years and went back to playing the organ, this time in nightclubs, </div>
<div id="ty_10" class="t s1_10">to earn a living while he continued his studies into his life’s fascination: the black arts. Once a week </div>
<div id="tz_10" class="t s1_10">he held classes in ritual magic at his home. They attracted many who were, or have since become </div>
<div id="t10_10" class="t s1_10">well known in the arts and sciences and business world. Eventually a “Magic Circle” evolved from </div>
<div id="t11_10" class="t s1_10">this group. </div>
<div id="t12_10" class="t s1_10">The major purpose of the Circle was to meet for the performance of black rituals that LaVey </div>
<div id="t13_10" class="t s1_10">had discovered. He had accumulated a library of works that described the Black Mass and other </div>
<div id="t14_10" class="t s1_10">pagan ceremonies conducted by groups such as the Knights Templar in 14th-Century France and </div>
<div id="t15_10" class="t s1_10">the Golden Dawn in 19th-Century England. The original intent of these black orders was to </div>
<div id="t16_10" class="t s1_10">blaspheme, mock the Christian church, and address themselves to the Devil as an anthropomorphic </div>
<div id="t17_10" class="t s1_10">deity that represented the reverse of God. In LaVey’s view, the Devil was much more than that. </div>
<div id="t18_10" class="t s1_10">Satan represented a dark, hidden force in nature that was responsible for the workings of earthly </div>
<div id="t19_10" class="t s1_10">affairs for which science and religion had no explanation and no control. </div>
<div id="t1a_10" class="t s1_10">“At first I detected this force in small ways,” LaVey explains. “It might be the discovery of an </div>
<div id="t1b_10" class="t s1_10">individual whose powers of wishing were so great that he could win horse races. In my case, I </div>
<div id="t1c_10" class="t s1_10">found I could conjure up parking places at the last minute in front of theaters, when none should </div>
<div id="t1d_10" class="t s1_10">have been there. I also discovered an ability through magic to bring reversals to enemies and gain </div>
<div id="t1e_10" class="t s1_10">advantage for myself. I realized I had stumbled onto something, and I would have gone on doing it </div>
<div id="t1f_10" class="t s1_10">on my own without any Magic Circle. But I also realized that for some things private magic was </div>
<div id="t1g_10" class="t s1_10">weaker than mass ritual magic.” </div>
<div id="t1h_10" class="t s1_10">Hence, on the last night of April 1966</div>
<div id="t1i_10" class="t s2_10">—Walpurgisnacht, </div>
<div id="t1j_10" class="t s1_10">the most important festival in the lore </div>
<div id="t1k_10" class="t s1_10">of magic and witchcraft—LaVey shaved his head in the tradition of ancient strongmen and </div>
