<div id="t1_15" class="t s1_15">INTRODUCTION by Burton H. Wolfe </div>
<div id="t2_15" class="t s2_15">This second introduction by Wolfe was used from 1976 through 2005 </div>
<div id="t3_15" class="t s3_15">On a winter’s evening in 1967, I drove crosstown in San Francisco to hear Anton Szandor </div>
<div id="t4_15" class="t s3_15">LaVey lecture at an open meeting of the Sexual Freedom League. I was attracted by newspaper </div>
<div id="t5_15" class="t s3_15">articles describing him as “the Black Pope” of a Satanic church in which baptism, wedding, and </div>
<div id="t6_15" class="t s3_15">funeral ceremonies were dedicated to the Devil. I was a free-lance magazine writer, and I felt there </div>
<div id="t7_15" class="t s3_15">might be a story in LaVey and his contemporary pagans; for the Devil has always made “good </div>
<div id="t8_15" class="t s3_15">copy,” as they say on the city desk. </div>
<div id="t9_15" class="t s3_15">It was not the practice of the black arts itself that I considered to be the story, because that is </div>
<div id="ta_15" class="t s3_15">nothing new in the world. There were Devil-worshipping sects and voodoo cults before there were </div>
<div id="tb_15" class="t s3_15">Christians. In eighteenth-century England a Hell-Fire Club, with connections to the American </div>
<div id="tc_15" class="t s3_15">colonies through Benjamin Franklin, gained some brief notoriety. During the early part of the </div>
<div id="td_15" class="t s3_15">twentieth century, the press publicized Aleister Crowley as the “wickedest man in the world.” And </div>
<div id="te_15" class="t s3_15">there were hints in the 1920s and ‘30s of a “black order” in Germany. </div>
<div id="tf_15" class="t s3_15">To this seemingly old story LaVey and his organization of contemporary Faustians offered two </div>
<div id="tg_15" class="t s3_15">strikingly new chapters. First, they blasphemously represented themselves as a “church,” a term </div>
<div id="th_15" class="t s3_15">previously confined to the branches of Christianity, instead of the traditional coven of Satanism and </div>
<div id="ti_15" class="t s3_15">witchcraft lore. Second, they practiced their black magic openly instead of underground. </div>
<div id="tj_15" class="t s3_15">Rather than arrange a preliminary interview with LaVey for discussion of his heretical </div>
<div id="tk_15" class="t s3_15">innovations, my usual first step in research, I decided to watch and listen to him as an unidentified </div>
<div id="tl_15" class="t s3_15">member of an audience. He was described in some newspapers as a former circus and carnival lion </div>
<div id="tm_15" class="t s3_15">tamer and trickster now representing himself as the Devil’s representative on earth, and I wanted to </div>
<div id="tn_15" class="t s3_15">determine first whether he was a true Satanist, a prankster, or a quack. I had already met people in </div>
<div id="to_15" class="t s3_15">the limelight of the occult business; in fact, Jeane Dixon was my landlady and I had a chance to </div>
<div id="tp_15" class="t s3_15">write about her before Ruth Montgomery did. But I had considered all the occultists phonies, </div>
<div id="tq_15" class="t s3_15">hypocrites, or quacks, and I would never spend five minutes writing about their various forms of </div>
<div id="tr_15" class="t s3_15">hocus-pocus. </div>
<div id="ts_15" class="t s3_15">All the occultists I had met or heard of were white-lighters: alleged seers, prophesiers, and </div>
<div id="tt_15" class="t s3_15">witches wrapping their supposedly mystic powers around God-based, spiritual communication. </div>
<div id="tu_15" class="t s3_15">LaVey, seeming to laugh at them if not spit on them in contempt, emerged from between the lines </div>
<div id="tv_15" class="t s3_15">of newspaper stories as a black magician basing his work on the dark side of nature and the carnal </div>
<div id="tw_15" class="t s3_15">side of humanity. There seemed to be nothing spiritual about his “church”. </div>
<div id="tx_15" class="t s3_15">As I listened to LaVey talk that first time, I realized at once there was nothing to connect him </div>
<div id="ty_15" class="t s3_15">with the occult business. He could not even be described as metaphysical. The brutally frank talk he </div>
<div id="tz_15" class="t s3_15">delivered was pragmatic, relativistic, and above all rational. It was unorthodox, to be sure: a blast at </div>
<div id="t10_15" class="t s3_15">established religious worship, repression of humanity’s carnal nature, phony pretense at piety in the </div>
<div id="t11_15" class="t s3_15">course of an existence based on dog-eat-dog material pursuits. It was also full of sardonic satire on </div>
<div id="t12_15" class="t s3_15">human folly. But most important of all, the talk was logical. It was not quack magic that LaVey </div>
<div id="t13_15" class="t s3_15">offered his audience. It was common sense philosophy based on the realities of life. </div>
<div id="t14_15" class="t s3_15">After I became convinced of LaVey’s sincerity, I had to convince </div>
<div id="t15_15" class="t s2_15">him</div>
<div id="t16_15" class="t s3_15">that </div>
<div id="t17_15" class="t s2_15">I</div>
<div id="t18_15" class="t s3_15">intended to do </div>
<div id="t19_15" class="t s3_15">some serious research instead of adding to the accumulation of hack articles dealing with the </div>
<div id="t1a_15" class="t s3_15">Church of Satan as a new type of freak show. I boned up on Satanism, discussed its history and </div>
<div id="t1b_15" class="t s3_15">rationale with LaVey, and attended some midnight rituals in the famous Victorian manse once used </div>
<div id="t1c_15" class="t s3_15">as Church of Satan headquarters. Out of all that I produced a serious article, only to find that was </div>
<div id="t1d_15" class="t s3_15">not what the publishers of “respectable” magazines wanted. They were interested in only the freak </div>
<div id="t1e_15" class="t s3_15">show kind of article. Finally, it was a so-called “girlie” or “man’s” magazine, </div>
<div id="t1f_15" class="t s2_15">Knight</div>
<div id="t1g_15" class="t s3_15">of September </div>
<div id="t1h_15" class="t s3_15">1968, that published the first definitive article on LaVey, the Church of Satan, and LaVey’s </div>
<div id="t1i_15" class="t s3_15">synthesis of the old Devil legends and black magic lore into the modern philosophy and practice of </div>
<div id="t1j_15" class="t s3_15">Satanism that all followers and imitators now use as their model, their guide, and even their Bible. </div>
<div id="t1k_15" class="t s3_15">My magazine article was the beginning, not the end (as it has been with my other writing </div>
<div id="t1l_15" class="t s3_15">subjects), of a long and intimate association. Out of it came my biography of LaVey, </div>
<div id="t1m_15" class="t s2_15">The Devil’s </div>
<div id="t1n_15" class="t s2_15">Avenger,</div>
<div id="t1o_15" class="t s3_15">published by Pyramid in 1974. After the book was published, I became a card-carrying </div>
<div id="t1p_15" class="t s3_15">member and, subsequently, a priest of the Church of Satan, a title I now proudly share with many </div>
