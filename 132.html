<div id="t1_132" class="t s1_132">called a Shibboleth ritual. In this type of ritual each of the participants chooses a pillar of society or </div>
<div id="t2_132" class="t s1_132">a type of person who is particularly awesome or irritating to him. Each then dresses in the costume </div>
<div id="t3_132" class="t s1_132">of the chosen victim. For about an hour all participants communicate with one another, all the while </div>
<div id="t4_132" class="t s1_132">acting out in parody what would be the actions of the persons portrayed. </div>
<div id="t5_132" class="t s1_132">After this psychodrama has been performed, a sort of kangaroo court is held, and the person </div>
<div id="t6_132" class="t s1_132">acting as Priest for the ritual takes the role of Satan. In the form of Satan he questions each person </div>
<div id="t7_132" class="t s1_132">individually. Each participant answers Satan’s questions in the manner in which his chosen </div>
<div id="t8_132" class="t s1_132">character would answer them. Through the favorite tools of the Devil, wile and guile, Satan exposes </div>
<div id="t9_132" class="t s1_132">the character for what he is. He talks him into selling his soul to the Devil, utilizing things which </div>
<div id="ta_132" class="t s1_132">are sacred cows to the shibboleth for the purpose of disguising his tactics. </div>
<div id="tb_132" class="t s1_132">In a ritual such as this, the purpose is to ridicule the shibboleth. In this way he will no longer be </div>
<div id="tc_132" class="t s1_132">awesome to the person who has suffered in some way by his actions. The situation in which the </div>
<div id="td_132" class="t s1_132">Satanist comes in contact with the shibboleth may be one in which he is forced to treat him in a </div>
<div id="te_132" class="t s1_132">civil or even respectful manner, but once the ritual has been performed, the Satanist can laugh up </div>
<div id="tf_132" class="t s1_132">his sleeve at the person. The shibboleth will sense that he is being patronized and will no longer </div>
<div id="tg_132" class="t s1_132">feel that he is capable of wielding the power that he once did over the Satanist. </div>
<div id="th_132" class="t s2_132">Part III: Magic as Practiced by the Satanic Church </div>
<div id="ti_132" class="t s1_132">There are many facets of magic that can be learned only through experience. A magus is one </div>
<div id="tj_132" class="t s1_132">who has become adept in the field of ritual magic. There are many scholars of magic who are not </div>
<div id="tk_132" class="t s1_132">capable of putting the theories which they have learned into practice. Others may have very little </div>
<div id="tl_132" class="t s1_132">formal training in magic but may have a natural ability to utilize the Powers of Darkness. </div>
<div id="tm_132" class="t s1_132">Knowledge can be a powerful tool, but without the common sense to put this knowledge into </div>
<div id="tn_132" class="t s1_132">practice, it is useless. Animals and small children are the most natural magicians. They have had </div>
<div id="to_132" class="t s1_132">little or no formal training and yet are adept at bending people and situations to their will. The </div>
<div id="tp_132" class="t s1_132">Satanist regards these small beings as sacred and realizes that he can learn much from them. </div>
<div id="tq_132" class="t s1_132">The Satanic Church is different from all other witchcraft or magical groups in the world today. </div>
<div id="tr_132" class="t s1_132">It is unlike the white magical groups, such as those in which the powers of magic are supposedly </div>
<div id="ts_132" class="t s1_132">used only for altruistic purposes. Nor is it a primitive group of cannibals whose membership is </div>
<div id="tt_132" class="t s1_132">made up of uneducated people. The Satanic Church is the first organization of its kind whose </div>
<div id="tu_132" class="t s1_132">membership consists largely of responsible, respectable people. Only by limiting our membership </div>
<div id="tv_132" class="t s1_132">to individuals of this variety, rather than appealing to the lunatic fringe, can we be certain of </div>
<div id="tw_132" class="t s1_132">becoming the strongest power structure in the world. Therefore membership in the Satanic Church </div>
<div id="tx_132" class="t s1_132">is not open to everyone. Unlike other religions in which you go to church to become a worthwhile </div>
<div id="ty_132" class="t s1_132">person, in the Satanic religion you must be a worthy person before you can come into church. Once </div>
<div id="tz_132" class="t s1_132">in the Church, you can reap the rewards which you deserve. The Satanic Church has too much to </div>
<div id="t10_132" class="t s1_132">offer to afford membership to people who are only seeking sensationalism or are of a personality </div>
<div id="t11_132" class="t s1_132">makeup that would reflect upon the Satanic religion in an unfavorable way. </div>
<div id="t12_132" class="t s1_132">The Satanic Church looks with disdain upon white witchcraft groups, as we feel that altruism is </div>
<div id="t13_132" class="t s1_132">sinning on the lay-away plan. It is unnatural not to have the desire to gain things for yourself. This </div>
<div id="t14_132" class="t s1_132">does not mean that you never do anything for anyone else. If you do something to make someone </div>
<div id="t15_132" class="t s1_132">for whom you care happy, his happiness will give you a sense of gratification. We practice a </div>
<div id="t16_132" class="t s1_132">modified form of the Golden Rule. Our interpretation of this rule is: “Do unto others as they do </div>
<div id="t17_132" class="t s1_132">unto you.” If you “do unto others as you would have them do unto you” and they in turn treat you </div>
<div id="t18_132" class="t s1_132">badly, it goes against human nature to continue to treat such people with consideration. You may do </div>
<div id="t19_132" class="t s1_132">unto others as you would have them do unto you; but if your kindness is not returned, they should </div>
<div id="t1a_132" class="t s1_132">be treated with the wrath they deserve. </div>
<div id="t1b_132" class="t s1_132">White witchcraft groups spout the theory that, if you curse a person, it will “return to you three-</div>
<div id="t1c_132" class="t s1_132">fold”, “come home to roost,” or in some way “boomerang back to the curser.” This is yet another </div>
<div id="t1d_132" class="t s1_132">indication of the guilt-ridden philosophy held by these neo-pagan, pseudo-Christian groups. These </div>
<div id="t1e_132" class="t s1_132">people want to delve into witchcraft but cannot divorce themselves from the stigma attached to it. </div>
<div id="t1f_132" class="t s1_132">Therefore they call themselves white magicians and base seventy-five percent of their philosophy </div>
<div id="t1g_132" class="t s1_132">on the trite and hackneyed tenets of Christianity. </div>
<div id="t1h_132" class="t s1_132">Anyone who pretends to be interested in magic for reasons other than gaining personal power is </div>
