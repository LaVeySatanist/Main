<div id="tw_127" class="t s1_127">beauty, is in the eye of the beholder. Christian missionaries were very unsuccessful in Alaska </div>

<div id="t17_127" class="t s1_127">one who has not had a satisfactory life. But to those who have experienced all of the joys that life </div>
<div id="t18_127" class="t s1_127">has to offer, there is a great dread attached to dying. This is as it should be. It is this lust for life that </div>

<div id="t1a_127" class="t s1_127">The only time an animal will resort to suicide is if he is in such pain or life is so unbearable that </div>
<div id="t1b_127" class="t s1_127">death comes as an indulgence rather than an abstinence. Suicide is considered a sin. It is rather </div>
<div id="t1c_127" class="t s1_127">curious that the only time death, for a human being, is considered sinful is when it comes as an </div>

<div id="t1g_127" class="t s1_127">One of the main goals of the Church of Satan is to build pleasure domes in which the members </div>
<div id="t1h_127" class="t s1_127">of the Church can indulge themselves in their personal desires. By having a place where they can </div>

<div id="t1j_127" class="t s1_127">Satanism advocates indulgence, not compulsion. Compulsion is very different from indulgence. </div>
