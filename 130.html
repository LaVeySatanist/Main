<div id="t2_130" class="t s1_130">The harboring of unwarranted guilt is very detrimental. We have been taught to feel guilty for </div>
<div id="t3_130" class="t s1_130">all of the things that we most naturally do. Many of us can realize intellectually that it is foolish to </div>
<div id="t4_130" class="t s1_130">feel guilty for these natural acts, but to accept this emotionally is another matter. If you cannot </div>
<div id="t5_130" class="t s1_130">release yourself from guilt, then you should learn to make it work for you. You should act upon </div>
<div id="t6_130" class="t s1_130">your natural instincts and then, realizing that you cannot perform these acts without feeling guilty, </div>
<div id="t7_130" class="t s1_130">revel in your guilt. This may sound like a contradiction in terms, but guilt can often add a fillip to </div>
<div id="t8_130" class="t s1_130">the senses. Adults would do well to take a lesson from children. Children often take delight in </div>
<div id="t9_130" class="t s1_130">doing something they know they are not supposed to. One of the first laws of magic is to turn every </div>
<div id="ta_130" class="t s1_130">disadvantage into an advantage. The quickest way of traveling between two points is in a straight </div>
<div id="tb_130" class="t s1_130">line. If all the guilts that have been built up can be turned into advantages, then intellectual scraping </div>
<div id="tc_130" class="t s1_130">of the psyche - in an attempt to cleanse it of these repressions - is eliminated. Satanism is the only </div>
<div id="td_130" class="t s1_130">religion known to man that accepts this rationale [of turning a bad thing into a good thing] rather </div>
<div id="te_130" class="t s1_130">than that of bending over backwards to eliminate the bad thing. </div>
<div id="tf_130" class="t s1_130">The Satanist shuns terms such as hope and prayer, as they are indicative of negative thinking. If </div>
<div id="tg_130" class="t s1_130">we hope or pray for something to come about, we will not act in a positive way which will make it </div>
<div id="th_130" class="t s1_130">happen. The Satanist commands, rather than prays to his god. Positive thinking results in positive </div>
<div id="ti_130" class="t s1_130">actions. Through positive thinking, combined with ritual, we command the forces of nature. We tell </div>
<div id="tj_130" class="t s1_130">ourselves “this will be done, come Hell or high water”, and therefore it is done. </div>
<div id="tk_130" class="t s1_130">Human beings have personality traits which are either passive or aggressive. Passivity and </div>
<div id="tl_130" class="t s1_130">aggressiveness are tamer terms for masochism and sadism. We are all made up of varying degrees </div>
<div id="tm_130" class="t s1_130">of these personality types. Some of us lean more towards one or the other, but it is rare to find an </div>
<div id="tn_130" class="t s1_130">individual who has equal portions of each of these traits. If a person is basically passive or </div>
<div id="to_130" class="t s1_130">masochistic, he would be most proficient in the mystic or mediumistic side of Satanism. This type </div>
<div id="tp_130" class="t s1_130">of person is the most natural psychic or medium. Such persons’ very passivity puts them in a </div>
<div id="tq_130" class="t s1_130">position of receptivity. </div>
<div id="tr_130" class="t s1_130">Since magic is based on positive force, the person who is basically aggressive or sadistic in </div>
<div id="ts_130" class="t s1_130">personality traits will do well as a magician. In the field of magic and Satanism, both passive and </div>
<div id="tt_130" class="t s1_130">aggressive people are necessary. The aggressive person is best suited for sending forces, and the </div>
<div id="tu_130" class="t s1_130">passive or mediumistic person is best utilized as a receptor. Generally a person with a great deal of </div>
<div id="tv_130" class="t s1_130">perception is passive. </div>
<div id="tw_130" class="t s1_130">It has been the popular misconception that Satanists practice human sacrifice. There has, </div>
<div id="tx_130" class="t s1_130">however, never been a clarification of the method used for sacrifice, or of the reasons for which a </div>
<div id="ty_130" class="t s1_130">Satanist would resort to this. When we sacrifice a person in a Satanic ritual, we do not slaughter </div>
<div id="tz_130" class="t s1_130">him on the altar in a physical manner. We simply direct our hate forces towards the deserving </div>
<div id="t10_130" class="t s1_130">recipient. You must never direct a curse toward a person unless you are prepared for the ultimate </div>
<div id="t11_130" class="t s1_130">consequences. </div>
<div id="t12_130" class="t s1_130">There is no such thing as a mild curse. If a curse is to be effective, you must feel the maximum </div>
<div id="t13_130" class="t s1_130">in disdain and hatred for the recipient. By sending these hate forces forth, we ensure suffering on </div>
<div id="t14_130" class="t s1_130">the part of the person who has dealt us an injustice. It can only be left to the victim’s environmental </div>
<div id="t15_130" class="t s1_130">conditions to decide what form our retribution will take, and a measure of the person’s rottenness as </div>
<div id="t16_130" class="t s1_130">to the degree he will suffer. </div>
<div id="t17_130" class="t s1_130">If the recipient of the curse has redeeming qualities of sufficient amounts, then he will not only </div>
<div id="t18_130" class="t s1_130">be saved but will be rehabilitated into a more worthwhile person as a result of the curse. Therefore </div>
<div id="t19_130" class="t s1_130">you cannot perform a working of this type and specify that you want the person to suffer only a </div>
<div id="t1a_130" class="t s1_130">broken arm or mild illness. You must realize that death may be the final outcome of a magical </div>
<div id="t1b_130" class="t s1_130">working of this nature. </div>
<div id="t1c_130" class="t s1_130">The Satanic Church feels that forcing oneself to feel indiscriminate love for all is very </div>
<div id="t1d_130" class="t s1_130">unnatural. There has never been any great love movement in the history of the world that has not </div>
<div id="t1e_130" class="t s1_130">wound up killing countless numbers of people to prove, we must assume, how much they loved </div>
<div id="t1f_130" class="t s1_130">them. Every hypocrite that ever walked the earth has had pockets bulging with love! You cannot </div>
<div id="t1g_130" class="t s1_130">love everyone, and by trying to you only lessen your feelings for the people who deserve your love. </div>
<div id="t1h_130" class="t s1_130">Repressed hate can lead to many physical ailments. For this reason you must periodically perform a </div>
<div id="t1i_130" class="t s1_130">hate ritual to rid yourself of this bottled-up hate. By choosing a deserving target for your hate </div>
