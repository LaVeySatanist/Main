<div id="t1_11" class="t s1_11">announced the formation of the Church of Satan. For proper identification as its minister, he put on </div>
<div id="t2_11" class="t s1_11">the clerical collar. Up to that collar, he almost looked holy. But the Genghis Khan shaved head, his </div>
<div id="t3_11" class="t s1_11">Mephistophelian beard, and his narrow eyes gave him the necessary demonic look for his </div>
<div id="t4_11" class="t s1_11">priesthood of the Devil’s church. </div>
<div id="t5_11" class="t s1_11">“For one thing,” LaVey explains, “calling it a church enabled me to follow the magic formula </div>
<div id="t6_11" class="t s1_11">of nine parts outrage to one part social respectability that is needed for success. But the main </div>
<div id="t7_11" class="t s1_11">purpose was to gather a group of like-minded individuals together for the use of their combined </div>
<div id="t8_11" class="t s1_11">energies in calling up the dark force in nature that is called Satan.” </div>
<div id="t9_11" class="t s1_11">As LaVey correctly perceived, all other churches are based on worship of the spirit and denial </div>
<div id="ta_11" class="t s1_11">of the flesh. He saw the need for a church that would recapture man’s body and carnal desires as </div>
<div id="tb_11" class="t s1_11">objects of celebration. “And,” he adds, “since worship of fleshly things produces pleasure, there </div>
<div id="tc_11" class="t s1_11">would then be a temple of glorious indulgence that would be fun for people. All the other churches </div>
<div id="td_11" class="t s1_11">are places of abstinence with services that people want to have over as soon as possible so they can </div>
<div id="te_11" class="t s1_11">get out and start enjoying life again.” </div>
<div id="tf_11" class="t s1_11">In the Church of Satan, LaVey initiated clever psychodramas that would enable a group of </div>
<div id="tg_11" class="t s1_11">flesh-worshippers to overcome the repressions and inhibitions fostered by the Judaeo-Christian </div>
<div id="th_11" class="t s1_11">tradition. He knew that the old concept of a Black Mass to satirize Christian services was </div>
<div id="ti_11" class="t s1_11">outmoded. There was a revolution in the Christian church itself against orthodox rites and </div>
<div id="tj_11" class="t s1_11">traditions. It was popular to declare that “God is dead.” So, the rites that he worked out, while still </div>
<div id="tk_11" class="t s1_11">maintaining the trappings of the ancient Black Mass, were changed from a negative mockery to </div>
<div id="tl_11" class="t s1_11">positive forms of celebrations: Satanic weddings, funerals devoid of sanctimonious platitudes, lust </div>
<div id="tm_11" class="t s1_11">rituals to help individuals attain their sex desires, destruction rituals to enable members of the </div>
<div id="tn_11" class="t s1_11">Satanic Church to triumph over enemies and win their goals in life. </div>
<div id="to_11" class="t s1_11">There is no altruism or love-thy-neighbor concept in the Satanic religion, except in the sense of </div>
<div id="tp_11" class="t s1_11">helping other adherents of the Black Path to gain their desires by group energy. Satanism is a </div>
<div id="tq_11" class="t s1_11">blatantly selfish, brutal religion. It is based on the belief that man is inherently a selfish, violent </div>
<div id="tr_11" class="t s1_11">creature, that life is a Darwinian struggle for survival of the fittest, that the earth will be ruled by </div>
<div id="ts_11" class="t s1_11">those who fight to win the ceaseless competition that exists in all jungles—including that of urban </div>
<div id="tt_11" class="t s1_11">societies. On that score, the Church of Satan may be justly criticized, although even its critics will </div>
<div id="tu_11" class="t s1_11">have to admit that its philosophy is based on logic and real conditions that exist in the world. </div>
<div id="tv_11" class="t s1_11">On the other hand, the great contribution to civilized thought made by the Church of Satan is its </div>
<div id="tw_11" class="t s1_11">celebration of the complete human being instead of the spirit alone. The signs are everywhere that </div>
<div id="tx_11" class="t s1_11">humanity is striving to burst the restrictive bonds of religion. It was predicted in the Bible, for that </div>
<div id="ty_11" class="t s1_11">matter, in symbolic passages that dealt with Satan chained for a thousand years, after which he </div>
<div id="tz_11" class="t s1_11">would break free and foment deviltry on the earth. Now it is happening. Sex is exploding in movies </div>
<div id="t10_11" class="t s1_11">and literature, on the streets, and in the home. People are dancing topless and bottomless. Youths </div>
<div id="t11_11" class="t s1_11">are throwing off restrictions that deny pleasure in mind and body. There is a ceaseless quest for </div>
<div id="t12_11" class="t s1_11">entertainment, gourmet foods and wines, adventure, enjoyment of the here and now. Man is no </div>
<div id="t13_11" class="t s1_11">longer willing to wait for any afterlife that promises to reward the clean, pure—translate: ascetic, </div>
<div id="t14_11" class="t s1_11">drab—spirit. There is a mood of neo-paganism and hedonism, and from it have emerged a wide </div>
<div id="t15_11" class="t s1_11">variety of intelligent individuals—doctors, lawyers, engineers, teachers, writers, actors, </div>
<div id="t16_11" class="t s1_11">stockbrokers, clerks, printers, nurses (to cite just a few categories of Satanic Church members)—</div>
<div id="t17_11" class="t s1_11">who are interested in carrying the liberation of the flesh all the way to a formal religion. </div>
<div id="t18_11" class="t s1_11">In the </div>
<div id="t19_11" class="t s2_11">Satanic Bible, </div>
<div id="t1a_11" class="t s1_11">Anton LaVey explains the philosophy of Satanism better than any of his </div>
<div id="t1b_11" class="t s1_11">ancestors in the Kingdom of Darkness, and describes the various rituals and trappings that have </div>
<div id="t1c_11" class="t s1_11">been devised to create a true church of flesh-worshippers. It is clear, from the interest in Satanism </div>
<div id="t1d_11" class="t s1_11">that erupted in 1968 along with the fascination directed toward Ira Levin’s book </div>
<div id="t1e_11" class="t s2_11">Rosemary’s Baby, </div>
<div id="t1f_11" class="t s1_11">that there are many people who would like to know how to start Satanic cults and ritualize black </div>
<div id="t1g_11" class="t s1_11">magic. This book shows them how to go about it and fills that need. It is also clear that there is a </div>
<div id="t1h_11" class="t s1_11">place for the formulation of teachings that constitute the antithesis to the repressive, inhibiting, anti-</div>
<div id="t1i_11" class="t s1_11">material dogma of Christianity and other antiquated religions. The </div>
<div id="t1j_11" class="t s2_11">Satanic Bible </div>
<div id="t1k_11" class="t s1_11">also fills that need. </div>
<div id="t1l_11" class="t s1_11">Perhaps the most important social value of this book is its challenge to other religions: Deal </div>
<div id="t1m_11" class="t s1_11">with carnal desire and the flesh in a logical, rational manner or lose the struggle not only for men’s </div>
<div id="t1n_11" class="t s1_11">bodies, but also their souls. </div>
